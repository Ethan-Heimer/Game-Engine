12/2/2023 7:27:48 PM: In class TextureRenderer: The Standard Rectangle Only Allows for int values, a coustom one with floting point values might be better
12/2/2023 7:27:48 PM: In class Game1: Theres a lot of init functions. Maybe a system to call static init functions might be better?
12/2/2023 7:27:48 PM: In class Renderer: The render uses a buffer which i feel might use alot of memory. when optimizing this might be a good place to start. a fun approch could be rendering with async, blocking the fuctions rendering calls until some blocking method is released
12/2/2023 7:27:48 PM: In class GameManagerWindow: Crash when loading scene
12/2/2023 7:27:48 PM: In class InspectorWindow: there Needs to be a way to tell when the ui needs to be rerendered
