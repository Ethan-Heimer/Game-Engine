1/10/2024 10:17:14 AM: In class Renderer: The render uses a buffer which i feel might use alot of memory. when optimizing this might be a good place to start. a fun approch could be rendering with async, blocking the fuctions rendering calls until some blocking method is released

1/10/2024 10:17:14 AM: In class ComponentFieldBinder`1: Every frame, GetValue() is called AT LEAST once (in HasValueChanged) as well as when ever Get Value is called. while maybe not that big of a performance hit, it is somthing to look into
1/10/2024 10:17:14 AM: In class FieldTemplate`1: Instead of tagging templates with interfaces, it might be better to use attributes
1/10/2024 10:17:14 AM: In class BoolFieldTemplate: Instead of tagging templates with interfaces, it might be better to use attributes
1/10/2024 10:17:14 AM: In class ColorFieldTemplate: Instead of tagging templates with interfaces, it might be better to use attributes

1/10/2024 10:17:14 AM: In class UITemplateFactory`1: GetTemplateType is the slowest thing ever written by man O(N^3) type beat
1/10/2024 10:17:14 AM: In class EditorGUIDrawer: Split Class Into formatter and drawer? // cache frequent classes like Thickness? || draw methods and get methods (returns without drawing)?
1/10/2024 10:17:14 AM: In class ElementStyle: Make Defaults are properties instead of functions
1/10/2024 10:17:14 AM: In class GameManagerWindow: Crash when loading scene
1/10/2024 10:17:14 AM: In class HiarchyWindow: To give gameobjects some structure, it might be a good idea to make a scene object that acts as the root node of the gameobject tree. every gameobject is a child of the root, and code might be cleaner because objects would have better structure
